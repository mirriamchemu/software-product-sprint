      <h1>My Background</h1>
      <p> My full name is Mirriam Chemutai Ronoh.
          I was born and raised in Kericho County, Kenya. A little bit about 
          my names; my grandmother gave me the name Mirriam, it's a Biblical name,
          though it's spelt Miriam in the Bible. In my tribe (Kipsigis), middle names
          are given with respect to the time of birth. I was named Chemutai because
          I was born at dawn. 'Mutai' means dawn in my tribe and 'Che' is a girl's
          name's prefix. Ronoh is my surname. I went to an all girls' 
          boarding school, Alliance Girls' High School,
           in a small town called Kikuyu, which is about
          an hour from the capital, Nairobi. After graduating from high school,
          I took a gap year before joining college. At the time, 
          I was working and applying for college. I was fortunate to 
          gain an admission to the University of Pennsylvania. At the time, I was 
          still undecided on what I wanted to pursue, and after taking some 
          Computer Science classes, I declared a Computer and Information Science
          major after my freshman year. I also plan to minor in Mathematics.
          Looking ahead, I am still quite unsure about what I want to do after graduation.
          I am interested in pursuing a Masters or a pHD program in Machine
          Learning. Artficial Intelligece fascinates me and I would love to be 
          part of the commmunity that is trying to positively change various aspects
          of life through computer technology. 
          </p>
          <p>During me free time, I like to stay indoors. Mostly, I like putting on 
              headphones and clean the house, organize my space or cook something I like.
               On a
              Friday night, you'd likely find me keeping up with a show on Netflix, going 
              to catch a movie at the theatre or just sleeping. My weekends are mostly 
              spent doing some schoolwork and hanging out with friends. On new interests,
              I am trying to learn how to play a violin and cook better.

          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>I haven't really worked on personal projects yet but I have worked 
              on some really interesting projects as part of my class assignments.
              Below are some of my favorites (all implemented in Java): </p>
          <p>(a)Travelling Salesperson Problem: In a problem with thousnads of destinations
              and distances between any two destinations, finding the shortest distance through
              all the destinations can be daunting. This problem was implemeted by use
              of simple iteration techniques such as a while loop and linked lists to 
              maintain the order of traversion of the whole map. </p>
 
          <p>(a)Spellchecker: Built a program that checks and corrects
              grammar mistakes in a file. This was accomplished by using File I/O
              to read an input file and every word mispelt corrected by rearranging 
              the letters into dictionary words. The new grammatically-correct file 
              is then made available to the user by writing to an output file.
          </p>
 
          <p>(a)Pennpals: Created an interactive chatting platform that enables users
              to register by assigning each user a distinct ID and username. Some users
              can create groups (channels), each with its name, where one user is the owner who admits
              other members and can also remove members. Users can send send messages
              to each other and also to channels.
          </p>
 
          <p>(a)Hashing and Tries: Implemented a working HashMap using a resizing linked
              list. Every new item inserted into the map is assigned a location 
              with respect to its key hashcode. 
               </p>

          <h1>Photography</h1>
          <p>During my freshamn year in college, I took a photography class.
              I found this class quite interesting because it was a black-and -white 
              photography class. This meant that we had to go outdoors and take
              a couple shots on film then spend about four hours in the dark room
              developing the films. We took a variety of pictures depending on the 
              theme of the week, portraiture, available light, cityscapes, etc. 
              I kept an album of some of my favorite shots from the class, four of which I've 
              shared below.
              On a random day, I enjoy photographing strutures with unique designs, 
              beatiful sceneries, and random pictures of my friends. </p>

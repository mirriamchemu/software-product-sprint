          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>I haven't really worked on personal projects yet but I have worked 
              on some really interesting projects as part of my class assignments.
              Below are some of my favorites (all implemented in Java): </p>
          <p>(a)Travelling Salesperson Problem: In a problem with thousnads of destinations
              and distances between any two destinations, finding the shortest distance through
              all the destinations can be daunting. This problem was implemeted by use
              of simple iteration techniques such as a while loop and linked lists to 
              maintain the order of traversion of the whole map. </p>
 
          <p>(a)Spellchecker: Built a program that checks and corrects
              grammar mistakes in a file. This was accomplished by using File I/O
              to read an input file and every word mispelt corrected by rearranging 
              the letters into dictionary words. The new grammatically-correct file 
              is then made available to the user by writing to an output file.
          </p>
 
          <p>(a)Pennpals: Created an interactive chatting platform that enables users
              to register by assigning each user a distinct ID and username. Some users
              can create groups (channels), each with its name, where one user is the owner who admits
              other members and can also remove members. Users can send send messages
              to each other and also to channels.
          </p>
 
          <p>(a)Hashing and Tries: Implemented a working HashMap using a resizing linked
              list. Every new item inserted into the map is assigned a location 
              with respect to its key hashcode. 
               </p>

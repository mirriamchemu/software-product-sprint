    <h3>Fridge-System Project</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> This project allows users in a household to manage their fridge contents. A fridge is assigned 
        an ID and has an owner, who allows other users have access to the fridge by either accepting their request
        or giving them an access code. Users can view the items in the fridge, see their expiry dates in order, view
        what item they are buying next and add items to the fridge.
    </li>
    <li> The project has both an android and a web app; both with different or almost similar features. </li>
    <li> <strong>Languages:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Databases.
